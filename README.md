# ATLANTIS - ArTificiaL And Natural waTer-bodIes dataSet
## A Benchmark for Semantic Segmentation of Waterbody Images

This is the respository for the ATLANTIS. All waterbody labels are comprehensively described in [ATLANTIS Wiki](https://github.com/smhassanerfani/atlantis/wiki).

For the first time, this dataset covers a wide range of natural waterbodies such as seas, lakes, rivers and man-made (artificial) water-related sturcures such as dams, reservoirs, canals, and piers. ATLANTIS includes 5,195 pixel-wise annotated images split to 3,364 training, 535 validation, and 1,296 testing images. In addition to 35 waterbody and water-related structures, this dataset covers 21 general labels.
